# Eazy-Light (1.0)
Eazy Light is a color scheme that should feel familiar to long-time Mac developers. Eazy Light coloring patterns are inspired by Chrome Developer Tools, XCode, Applescript, BBEdit, Flash Develoepr, and Eifell color schemes. If you are looking for a light color scheme that harmonizes well with others, give Eazy Light a try.
